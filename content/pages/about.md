# About NuMark

NuMark is a next-generation static site generator designed for developers who want the power of modern web technologies without the complexity of traditional frameworks.

## Our Mission

We believe that creating websites should be both powerful and simple. SideGen bridges the gap between the flexibility developers need and the simplicity content creators want.

## Technology Stack

NuMark is built on a foundation of proven, modern technologies:

- **React**: For component-based templates and layouts
- **TailwindCSS**: For utility-first styling and responsive design
- **Vite**: For fast development and optimized builds
- **Node.js**: For the build system and development tools
- **Markdown**: For content creation with frontmatter support

## Key Principles

### Developer First
We prioritize developer experience with modern tooling, hot reloading, and intuitive APIs.

### Performance Focused
Every feature is designed with performance in mind, from build times to runtime optimization.

### Flexible by Design
NuMark adapts to your workflow, not the other way around.

### Community Driven
We believe in open source and community contributions to make SideGen better for everyone.

## The Team

NuMark is developed by a passionate team of developers who understand the challenges of modern web development. We're committed to creating tools that make developers more productive and websites faster.
